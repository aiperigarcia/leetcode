//Given an array of integers, return a new array with each value doubled.

//For example:

//[1, 2, 3] --> [2, 4, 6]

//For the beginner, try to use the map method - it comes in very handy quite a lot so is a good one to know.


function maps(x){
  let newArr = x.map((i) => {
    return i * 2
  })
  return newArr
}
